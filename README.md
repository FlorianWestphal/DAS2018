This project accompanies the paper:

Westphal, F., Lavesson, N., & Grahn, H. (2018). Document Image Binarization Using Recurrent Neural Networks. In *Document Analysis Systems (DAS), 2018 13th IAPR Workshop*

An implementation of the approach proposed in this paper and a description of how to use it can be found in the `src` folder. 
A pre-trained model can be found in the `model` folder and the raw data from the performed experiments can be found in the `data` folder.
